  ## Installation
  Install by visiting this link https://morning-plateau-74907.herokuapp.com/.
  
  ## Usage
  Once the application is opened in the browser, User will be presented with intro page and a "Get Started" button that, when clicked, will lead to the page where notes (titles and text) can be entered. To add a note, User will click on "Note Title" and "Note Text" fields to type data. Once User begins to type into the "Note Text" field a save disk icon will appear in the upper right corner along the navigation bar. Once the disk is clicked the newly entered note will appear in the left column where it will remain until deleted by User. Currently, the red trash/delete icon does not have deletion capabilities.
